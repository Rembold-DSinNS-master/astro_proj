## Paper Sources
While just using Google or Google Scholar can always work, the the main source I always go to when looking for astronomy papers is [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/). This interface gives you an easy way to search, almost all the papers will have a free pdf available (look for the arXiv option under the FULL TEXT SOURCES). You can also preview images directly from the site if you want to see if anything looks interesting before evenÂ reading parts of the paper. If you find something interesting there is even a "similar papers" link that you can follow to find more similar stuff. If you are at a loss of what to search for, some suggestions I might offer would be, but are certainly not limited to:
- Include the name of a major telescope survey in your search (Gaia, SDSS, Hubble, etc) to get some more specific papers
- Stars or particular stellar populations (main sequence, red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes)
- Exoplanets (habitable, evolution, surveys)
- Galaxies (evolution, composition, distributions)
- Binary stars

Keep in mind that to find papers relating to more data science type applications, you can always specify terms that are more likely to apply. Terms like: survey, statistics, distribution, machine learning, etc can help make sure you are seeing fewer theory papers.
