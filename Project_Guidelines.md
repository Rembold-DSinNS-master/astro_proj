## Guidelines
Choosing a good project can be a non-trivial task, and can often require looking through a variety of scientific literature. Here are some guidelines for what I'm looking for in a good project:

- **Utilizes data directly from an observational source**
  Data should be taken in its (mostly) raw form directly from the observational source. This gives you a chance to futher develop skills in navigating database websites, APIs, and data cleaning.

- **Showcases an interesting scientific question**
  This is not just an exercise in data exploration, but in using the data to make an empirical argument. Basing projects off of interesting graphics in scientific literature can be a good method of ensuring that your analysis has scientific merit (since that is what scientific authors use figures for) without needing to understand all the underlying science in detail.

- **Results can be summarized in some form of visualization**
  Figures are the most accepted way scientists convey meaning and support their conclusions. If you are basing your project around an existing figure in a paper, then this goal should be obvious. If you are not directly basing it off a figure, understand that you will need to create some form of figure to summarize your results in the end.

- **Evidence of comparison to some scientific model**
  This might take the form of fitting results to a specific model to find certain parameters, or it might take the approach of plotting results for a model on a plot alongside the data for a visual comparison.

- **Written work mimics the structure of academic papers**
  The paper that you write as part of the project should follow along with classic scientific literature structure. This means it should include an abstract, an introduction, an outline of your methods, your results and conclusions. References should be cited and all visuals should be referenced directly in the text and include descriptive captions.

- **Produced visuals are easy to read and contain all necessary information**
  Visuals should be clean and easy to parse so as to better convey their message. Legends should be included where appropriate, and all axes or colorbars should be clearly labeled, including units where appropriate. Many standalone scientific figures do not include a plot title, as that is covered in the caption, but if you have a more complex figure containing multiple plots, each plot should be clearly titled so that readers understand what they are looking at.

- **Presentation within time limit and clearly communicates the work done and the found results and conclusions.**
  Presentations should be no longer than 12 minutes in length, and should convey all the necessary information for peers in the class to be able to understand the work that was done and appreciate the results and conclusions that were made. Partners should share speaking responsibilities fairly equally, and be prepared to answer some questions from their peers upon the conclusion of the presentation.

So long as the project meets those general guidelines, I am happy with it! My goal is to not lock down the projects so tightly to ensure they all have the same "difficulty", but rather to leave you enough flexibility to engage with the material to the extent that you see fit and desire.
